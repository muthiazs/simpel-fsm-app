## Overview

**Simpel-FSM-App** is a comprehensive solution for managing and streamlining the Foreign Official Travel (PDLN) request process. This application digitalizes the traditionally manual submission process, enabling better efficiency and accountability across departments.

## PKL Description

This Field Work Practice (PKL) was carried out at the Faculty of Science and Mathematics, Diponegoro University, with the aim of developing a web-based application for submitting requests for Foreign Official Travel Approval (PDLN). The previous process was considered inefficient as submissions were made through personal messages, document verification took a long time, and supporting letters were prepared individually.

To address these issues, a web application was developed that digitizes the entire PDLN request process. Users can fill out submission forms, upload required documents, and track the status of their requests through an intuitive dashboard. Admin users are able to verify documents, manage requests, and generate official supporting letters directly from the system. All submitted data is stored securely in a centralized database, ensuring ease of access and archival.

This web application was developed using the **Waterfall system development method**, which consists of the stages: *communication*, *planning*, *modeling*, *construction*, and *deployment*. The application was built using the **TypeScript** programming language with the **ElysiaJS** framework for the backend, **Next.js** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database management system.

The result of this PKL is a web application that facilitates the digital submission of PDLN requests, accelerates the verification process, and stores data centrally. This application is expected to improve the efficiency of foreign official travel administration within the faculty.
